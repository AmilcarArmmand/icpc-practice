# Welcome to the ICPC-Practice repo!

## The purpose of this repo is to collaborate and house all solutions to [open kattis](open.kattis.com) problems and organize your files and folders.

To get started, you should create a folder on your computer to house all of your project files. "folder name: [your name]"

Documentation: This folder should contain any relevant documentation related to your project, such as project plans, meeting minutes, and user manuals.

Source Code: This folder should contain all of your source code files.

Data: This folder should contain any data files needed for your project, such as spreadsheets, text files, or images.

Output: This folder should contain any output files generated by your project, such as reports or graphs.

Resources: This folder should contain any additional resources you need for your project, such as external libraries or third-party tools.

By creating these sub-folders, you can keep your files organized and easily accessible. Additionally, you can use this structure as a starting point and modify it to suit your specific needs.

Thank you for using this template and happy organizing!
