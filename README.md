# Welcome to the ICPC-Practice repo!

## The purpose of this repo is to collaborate and house all solutions to [open kattis](open.kattis.com) problems and organize your files and folders. 

1) To get started, you should create a folder on your computer to house all of your project files. "folder name: [your name]"
    ![icpc-folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76856697/232063115-44c9ae82-d298-459a-bbd6-f832729770fb.png)
    
    Documentation: This folder should contain any relevant documentation related to your project, if project has multiple files consider creating
    sub-folders to keep relavant files together.

    Source Code: This folder should contain all of your source code files.

    Data: This folder should contain any data files needed for your project, such as spreadsheets, text files, or images. 

    By creating these sub-folders, you can keep your files organized and easily accessible. Additionally, you can use this structure as a starting point
    and  modify it to suit your specific needs.
    
 2) Clone the icpc-practice project to you local machine and add the folder (created in step 1 ) to the project and then you may add or delete files inside     your folder (do not modify any other folders)
